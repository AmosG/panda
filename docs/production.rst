=====================
Production deployment
=====================

We provide documentation on two ways of installing PANDA for production use: one using Amazon's EC2 server and another using hardware of your choice.

Amazon EC2
==========

Non-advanced users and those who desire the simplest setup possible should plan to install their PANDA on Amazon's EC2 service. This is the best supported option.

Self-install
============

Those who are concerned about the security of storing in the cloud or who have access to dedicated hardware may wish to install PANDA on their server. Although we make every effort to support this, we can not offer any guarantee of compatability.
