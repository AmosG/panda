Email

Before you installing PANDA you're going to need access to an SMTP server for sending email. If you don't know what that is or you don't have easy access to one, please read our `guide to Email <email.html>`_.

Installation
============

Server requirements
-------------------

PANDA requires a server running Ubuntu 11.04. Whether you want to run PANDA in a virtual machine or on the old Compaq under your desk, as long as it can run Ubuntu 11.04, you should be fine.
