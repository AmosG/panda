Before you configure PANDA you're going to need access to an SMTP server for sending email.

If you're organization already has one of these that you can use then you just need to make sure you have its address, port number, username and password ready so you can fill them in later. 

If you don't have access to an email server you'll need to set one up. There are a variety of ways to do this, but the easiest way is to use a service. We recommend `Sendgrid <http://sendgrid.com>`_, because they offer a free plan for less than 200 emails a day and the stay affordable if and when you exceed that limit.
