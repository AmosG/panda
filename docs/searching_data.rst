Finding data with PANDA
=======================

PANDA provides to important ways of searching for data. From the "Search" page you can search across data in all datasets that have been uploaded to PANDA. This is typically used for research. From an individual dataset's page you can search the data for just that one dataset. This is appropriate if you are looking for a very specific row or rows of data.

Searching across all datasets
=============================

To search across all datasets click the "Search" link from the navigation bar across the top of the screen. (This is also the default or "home" page for your PANDA.) You will see a search form at the top of the page.

Enter your search keywords. The more detailed your search, the fewer results you should expect to get. Keep in mind that the order of the terms doesn't matter, so if you are searching for a particular individual you can input the name as "first last" or "last first" without affecting the results.

PANDA can not know about variations in terms, such as nick-names or abbreviations. If you need to search for such variations you will want to consult the advanced search features. Hover your mouse over the word "Advanced" for details.

As an example, searching for ``doe AND (jon OR john OR jane)`` will (presumably) find all John and Jane Doe's in any dataset.

Once you have your query constructed click the "Search" button. On the resulting page you will see a list of datasets that had matching data, with some example rows from each. If there are more results than could be displayed in the preview there will be a "View more results from this dataset" link that will take you to complete search within that specific dataset.

Searching within a single dataset
=================================

To search across a specific dataset visit its details page. At the top of that page you will see a search box.

This search field functions identically to the universal search function described above, with the exception that it only searches within a single dataset. For details of how to use advanced search syntax or to search using "column filters", click the "More search options" link.
